### Project Overview

---

This project focuses on compiling and analyzing data related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a World Health Organization (WHO) report.

### Data Sources

The project leverages a public dataset on from Our World In Data on the WHO COVID-19 Report which include;
- "owid-covid-data.csv" file, containing detailed information about the COVID-19 Impact on the world.

### Tools
- Excel - Univariate Analysis
- Power Query - Data Cleaning and Preparation
- PowerBI - Data Visualization
 
### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the datasets to answer key questions such as:

- Total Cases
- Total Population
- Total Deaths
- Total Countries
- Country with the highest number of Cases
- Country with the highest number of Deaths
- Country with the highest number of Population  
- Cases and Deaths trend by Year
- Cases and Deaths trend by Month
- Cases and Deaths trend by Continent
- Population by Continent

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- A total of 2,097,376,762 cases were identified.
- A total of 4,721,383,370 people were identified in the population.
- A total of 17,999,358 deaths were identified.
- There seems to be a difference in the reported number of countries. While 221 was identified, there are generally 195 recognized countries by the United Nations.
- China leads the world with 99,347,448 COVID-19 cases.
- Brazil reported the highest number of COVID-19 deaths at 702,116.
- India had the highest Population at 1,417,173,120.
- The data shows 2022 had the most cases at 1,197,013,766, while 2021 saw the highest number of deaths at 8,914,843.
- January appears to have the highest number of both Cases (434,516,618) and Deaths (2,185,736).
- Asia had the highest Cases at 271,574,615 and Europe had the highest Deaths at 1,757,668.
- Asia had the highest Population at 1,425,887,360.


### Limitations
- Testing isn't uniform across all countries. Asymptomatic cases and mild cases may go untested, leading to an underestimation of the true number of infections.
- Reporting practices can vary by country. This can make it difficult to directly compare data from different regions.
- WHO reports primarily on confirmed cases, which can miss the full picture of the pandemic's spread.
- Deaths can take weeks to be reported after infection, so death data may not reflect the most recent trends.
